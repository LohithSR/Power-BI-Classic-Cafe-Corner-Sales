### Data Preparation:

The following SQL queries were used to clean and transform the coffee shop sales data before importing it into Power BI for analysis.

**Convert Date and Time Columns:**

```sql
UPDATE coffee_shop_sales
SET transaction_date = STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d-%m-%Y');
```

**Total Sales Calculation:**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS Total_Sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5;
```

**Sales By Product Category:**

```sql
SELECT product_category, 
ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) AS Total_Sales
